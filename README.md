2. Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output. o Finally store the output in output.txt file. Example: Input: a file includes two lines: Python Course Deep Learning Course Output: Python Course Deep Learning Course Word_Count: Python: 1 Course: 2 Deep: 1 Learning: 1

   SOLUTION:opening the file by using the open() function and giving tha path of the files of both input and output files

   Then reading the file by using the readlines() function and writing the data by using writelines() function then splitting the sentance by using the split() function and then separting then printing the words.
